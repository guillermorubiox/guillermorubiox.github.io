I"I<p>Simple design drawn in Illustrator.
<br /><br />
The idea behind this was a personalized GIF to be sent to friends/coworkers/family when you're going to be AFK or simply need to go run a quick errand. 
<br /><br />
I referenced a running person and added an exaggeration on her legs to make it look like she's hopping. I added an exaggeration on her arms to amplify the size of the grocery bag.
<br /><br />
The added movement to her hair, stars, and moon helped make this feel a laidback kind of GIF. 
<br /><br />
This was animated in Illustrator and finalized in photoshop. </p>
