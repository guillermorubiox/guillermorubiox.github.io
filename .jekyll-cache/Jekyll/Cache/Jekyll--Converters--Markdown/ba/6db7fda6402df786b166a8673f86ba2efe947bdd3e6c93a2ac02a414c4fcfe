I"Ó<p>Like most of my illustrations, I start with a rough draft in a sketchbook. I referenced real-life sharks, fishes, and plants that would be easy to find in most aquariums. 
<br /><br />
I took a photo of my rough draft and opened it in Illustrator. I added natural colors and texture to bring a rough 2D drawing into a colorful one. 
<br /><br />
The idea behind this illustration was to give thanks to the aquariums that do their part to sustain marine life. </p>
