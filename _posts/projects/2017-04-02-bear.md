<p>I started this illustration in Illustrator using a Wacom Tablet. 
<br><br>
The theme behind this was a friendship card so I used honey-colors primarily to promote the friendliness between a bear and a rabbit. 
<br><br>
Color was added in Illustrator and texture was added in Photoshop. 
<br><br>
Everything was drawn free-hand. </p>
