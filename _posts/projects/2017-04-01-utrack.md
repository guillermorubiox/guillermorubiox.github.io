<p>Utrack is an app that tracks all your orders in one app just by connecting your email. Utrack will use your email information to fetch any data concerning processed orders, shipped orders, and delivered orders.
<br><br>
I used Illustrator to design a simple, easy-to-read logo that will appear on the start-up screen. I also designed the small icons on Illustrator.
<br><br>
Using Xd, I created an interface for all the interactive screens. 
To keep its simplistic design, I chose to do a simple menu with access buttons at the bottom to have everything available in one click. 
<br><br>
Easily access orders that are in transit or orders that have been delivered by sliding the top button. 
<br><br>
Orders are organized in a bubble of their own. Users can view the order's email, item link, and item details like tracking numbers, and order date in the same bubble. 
<br><br>
Delivered items can be favorited for bookmarking by double-tapping on any order. Details can be viewed like delivery date, item link, and order total. 
<br><br>
Orders can be sorted by order date, recent, and A-Z. 
<br><br>
Notifications can be seen on the top right. The user will be notified when there is an update on an order. 
<br><br>
By using easy accessibility and designs, users will find the app easy to use. </p>
