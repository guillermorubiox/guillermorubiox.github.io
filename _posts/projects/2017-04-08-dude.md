<p>Collaborated with Matt Lundstrom to present a cover for a work-from-home themed playlist for the Palisades Media Group family as we transitioned from our office jobs to remote.
<br><br>
Because the theme was working from home, we chose a business suit stock photo as the center. 
<br><br>
Inspired by a futuristic setting, I added a cyber background to give the feel of the future. The waves-for-head were added to help further contribute to a futuristic feel. The waves were done on illustrator. 
<br><br>
Photoshop was used to add lighting effects. I also fixed the color in Photoshop.

Thanks for working hard, Palisaders!</p>
